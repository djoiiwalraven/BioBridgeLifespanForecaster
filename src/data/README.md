Move all data files into this folder/package but do not push anything that's inside this folder to GitHub. This is because in our code we want to refer to this folder and at the end of the project save this project and it's data files inside this folder. But these files are too big for GitHUb. Also always copy the data files into this folder while also storing them somewhere else on your computer.
